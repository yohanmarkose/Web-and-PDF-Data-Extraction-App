Eco- nomic stability and some degree of predictability en- able people to plan and invest in their future and that of their children. They encourage innovation, rein- force social connections and build trust in others and in institutions.1 Worry and anxiety about the future have negative health outcomes, ranging from mental health problems to heart disease and increased risk of obesity, including among children.2 Pervasive eco- nomic insecurity generates popular discontent and imperils political stability.\nEven before the Covid-19 pandemic, many peo- ple found themselves and their families on shaky economic ground. Growing employment instability and work that is increasingly precarious and poorly paid, together with persistent joblessness, are root causes of rising economic insecurity in high-income countries. In low- and middle-income countries high informal employment continues to affect income stability. People can no longer rely on stable, decent work to provide economic stability throughout their lives-a trend compounded by the Covid-19 pandem- ic and an emerging climate crisis.\nIncreased awareness of climate change and its many implications has injected growing uncertainty about the future and raised people's concerns about their wellbeing in the long run. Even though the ef- fects are shaping anxieties worldwide, the impacts will be uneven. People in the poorest countries, par- ticularly children and young people, stand to lose the most.\nIndeed, people in poverty are more exposed to ad- verse events, from ill health to the growing impacts of systemic shocks such as climate change and pan- demics, and have fewer resources to cope with and recover from their consequences. However, many people who are not poor by national or international standards are or feel economically insecure as well. In fact, while economic security and confidence in the future have traditionally been defining features\nof the middle class, this group is feeling increasing- ly insecure.3 Workers in the informal economy and the growing number of people under nonstandard contractual arrangements are highly insecure, as are people with lower education levels, women, younger adults, members of racial and ethnic minorities and heads of single-parent households.4\nDespite its significance, growing economic in- security has stayed under the policy radar in many countries. Experts find fault in the fact that it is not adequately reflected in standard national statistics.5 Indeed, many measurement issues related to inse- curity are still unresolved, and empirical research on developing countries is scarce.\nWhatever the method used to assess economic risks, the implications of these risks depend crucial- ly on the buffers available. Catastrophic expenses and large debts drive falls into poverty when social protection systems do not help guard against risks or cover their effects. Even in developed countries with comprehensive social protection systems, compara- tive cross-country data suggest that public transfers protect only about 40 percent of adults against large drops in disposable income (drops of 25 percent of disposable income or above).6\nNot only are risks growing, but policies are also not keeping up with current trends. Public institu- tions, policies and governance systems are struggling to adapt to rapidly changing needs across countries. Social protection coverage is often contingent on a traditional formal employer-employee relationship, and many schemes are not portable across jobs. La- bour market institutions and regulations are also challenged by the growing diversification of working arrangements.\nThere are, however, policy innovations in both de- veloped and developing countries that demonstrate the capacity of social protection systems, labour market institutions and public services to adapt to changing circumstances. These include new forms\n62\nHUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022\nof social protection that adequately cover informal workers, migrant workers or those with nonstandard contracts.7 There are also agile programmes that au- tomatically scale up in response to systemic shocks, such as pandemics or climate-related emergencies. Some groups of informal workers have pursued new models of collective representation to protect their interests, namely through cooperatives, self- help groups and associations. Some of these new organizations have helped workers connect and un- dertake collective action, but many lack the legal capacity to negotiate working conditions. A key challenge for these organizations is that many in- formal workers are not considered workers under the law and therefore do not have bargaining rights. In some countries-Canada, Germany and Swe- den, for instance-collective bargaining rights have been extended to some categories of self-employed workers.8\nProviding economic security remains a key role of the state and its institutions and is a foundation of the social contract between government and citi- zens. Many governments spend a substantial share of GDP to safeguard against hardship-causing loss- es, through social protection systems, healthcare and other public services. This is a crucial moment to re- flect on how to adapt past policies and institutions to a new socioeconomic reality.\nLarge-scale crises heighten risk and insecurity and have, at times, opened a path to renew the social con- tract. The unprecedented income support and health measures put in place by many governments as a re- sponse to the Covid-19 pandemic attest to the prima- ry role that the state continues to play in confronting economic risk and insecurity. Policy responses to the crisis have ranged from direct payroll support to employers to covering income losses in informal\nemployment to rent payments and eviction moratori- ums, not to mention expanding healthcare coverage in traditionally underserved areas.9\nHowever, many of these measures are temporary. Most of them leave beneficiaries just as vulnerable to future shocks once they are removed. Compre- hensive, universal social protection systems, when in place, play a much more durable role in protecting workers and in reducing the prevalence of poverty than short-term, ad hoc measures, since they act as automatic stabilizers. They provide basic income se- curity at all times and therefore enhance people's ca- pacity to manage and overcome shocks.\nCountries with social protection systems already in place were able to scale them up quickly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Investments in building and expanding social protection systems in some Latin American countries over the past decades have cush- ioned the fallout from the crisis, at least in the short term.10 Many other low- and middle-income coun- tries entered the crisis on weak financial footing, however. Their ability to expand social protection has been constrained by lack of fiscal space as well as by a lack of existing mechanisms on which to build. Overall, the financial support to individuals and fam- ilies has varied dramatically across countries, as has access to vaccines and thus the speed of econom- ic recovery. Without urgent corrective action from the international community, the current crisis is likely to widen disparities both within and between countries.11\nFocusing on the challenges people face today- from increasingly precarious employment to inad- equate healthcare and difficulty accessing social protection, housing and other public services-can narrow social, economic and political divides and guard against the next global crisis.\nNOTES\n1\nFor a broad assessment of economic insecurity and its measurement, see Stiglitz, Fitoussi and Durand (2018).\n6 On average, although the percentage varies widely across countries.

Some of these new organizations have helped workers connect and un- dertake collective action, but many lack the legal capacity to negotiate working conditions. A key challenge for these organizations is that many in- formal workers are not considered workers under the law and therefore do not have bargaining rights. In some countries-Canada, Germany and Swe- den, for instance-collective bargaining rights have been extended to some categories of self-employed workers.8"

Overall, the financial support to individuals and fam- ilies has varied dramatically across countries, as has access to vaccines and thus the speed of econom- ic recovery.
